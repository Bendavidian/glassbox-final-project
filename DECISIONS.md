## 2026-08-14 — GB-6: the paper endpoint is a constant, and the guard lives in the config layer

**Decision.** `PAPER_ENDPOINT` is a module constant in `config/loader.py`.
`alpaca_credentials()` now defaults `base_url` to it when `ALPACA_BASE_URL` is unset
(it previously returned `None`), and a new `require_paper_endpoint()` raises unless the
resolved endpoint is exactly that. `scripts/smoke_alpaca.py` calls the guard before it
constructs a client. Operational scripts live in `scripts/`, outside the package.

**Reasoning.** Three small choices, one theme — put the safety check where it can be
tested and cannot be forgotten:

* The endpoint is not a tunable, so it is not a `settings.yaml` key. Spec §5 froze that
  schema, and a value whose whole purpose is to be immovable does not belong in a file
  people edit. This is the second deliberate exception to CLAUDE.md rule 5, after
  `LARGE_MOVE_LOG_RETURN`; both are flagged rather than buried.
* Defaulting an unset endpoint to `None` pushed the decision to every caller. Defaulting
  it to paper makes the safe value the default, so forgetting to configure anything is
  safe rather than undefined.
* The guard sits in the config layer, not in the script, because a script cannot be
  imported by the test suite. Nine tests now cover the accept and refuse paths, including
  a lookalike host (`paper-api.alpaca.markets.evil.example`) and plain HTTP.

`scripts/` is documented in spec §3.4 as sitting outside the package: scripts import
`glassbox`, nothing imports them, they are not packaged, and they are outside the layer
contract. They are deliberately *not* in `SPEC_MODULES`, which guards the importable
tree; the scaffold test only walks `glassbox/`, so no exemption was needed — only a line
in the spec so the next session does not put library code there.

**Consequence.** Any future broker-touching code calls `require_paper_endpoint()` first.
`tests/config/test_config.py` also now scans `scripts/` for direct environment access, so
the single-source-of-truth rule extends beyond the package.

## 2026-08-14 — Considered and rejected: caching site-packages in CI

**Decision.** CI keeps `actions/setup-python`'s pip cache and installs from
`requirements.lock` on every run. No site-packages or virtualenv caching is added.

**Reasoning.** Measured, not assumed. Run 176fe01 (cold cache) took **2m45s**; run
067d10f (warm cache, lockfile unchanged) took **2m12s**. The 33-second difference
confirms what the mechanism predicts: `setup-python`'s pip cache stores the HTTP download
cache, so torch is not re-downloaded but every wheel is still reinstalled, and
installation dominates. Caching site-packages keyed on the lockfile hash would skip
installation, but it breaks in subtle ways — absolute paths in `.pth` files, editable
install metadata — and CI that fails incomprehensibly costs far more than CI that takes
thirty seconds longer. At roughly 40 remaining pushes to submission, the whole
optimisation is worth about 20 minutes.

**Consequence.** Expect ~2m10s per push. If a future change makes CI materially slower —
a heavier dependency, a long test suite — revisit with fresh measurements rather than
from memory of this entry.

## 2026-08-14 — GB-4: the parquet cache is a snapshot, and downloads are per-symbol

**Decision.** `load_history` downloads one symbol per yfinance call rather than
requesting the universe in bulk. A cached symbol is returned exactly as stored, however
old; there is no incremental top-up. Refreshing is explicit, via `force_refresh=True`.

**Reasoning.** Per-symbol keeps one parsing path — yfinance's column layout changes shape
with the number of tickers requested — and maps one-to-one onto the per-symbol cache
files, so a partial cache fetches only what is missing and one bad ticker cannot fail the
universe. Five daily requests cost about eleven seconds, once.

Staleness is the more consequential half. Spec §7.4 caches the study's data to parquet so
the grid runs against a fixed snapshot, and GB-59 requires a clean clone to reproduce
reported results. A loader that silently extended its data each day would make two runs
of the same study disagree with no code change, and the disagreement would be invisible
in the output. Explicit refresh makes the snapshot boundary a decision someone took,
rather than a side effect of what day it happens to be.

**Consequence.** Re-running the study tomorrow uses today's data unless the cache is
refreshed deliberately. Every cache hit logs its last bar, so staleness is visible in the
run log. The live loop does not use this module — it reads `data/live.py` (GB-7).

**Enforcement, added the same day.** A log line is not enough: it relies on someone
remembering to refresh in the last week of the project, which is exactly the week nobody
remembers anything. So the snapshot date is carried into the deliverable instead. Spec §9
now requires `results.csv` to carry a `data_snapshot_last_bar` column (GB-49) and the
generated report to print it in the summary table header (GB-52). A report built on
August data then says so on the page the supervisor reads, which turns a discipline
problem into a visible fact. Implemented in GB-49 and GB-52, not before.

## 2026-08-14 — Python floor raised to 3.12; CI installs from `requirements.lock`

**Decision.** `requires-python` becomes `>=3.12`, CI pins `python-version: "3.12"`, and
ruff and black target `py312`. CI installs `pip install -r requirements.lock` followed by
`pip install -e . --no-deps` instead of resolving from `pyproject.toml`. `CLAUDE.md` §4
and spec §12 now say Python 3.12+.

**Reasoning.** CI went red the moment dependency lower bounds were added. `numpy>=2.5.2`
and `scipy>=1.18.0` — the versions this project is developed against — both declare
`requires_python >= 3.12`, so pip cannot satisfy them on the 3.11 floor the workflow
pinned, and the job died in the install step before reaching torch. The 3.11 floor was
never real: it was a claim in `pyproject.toml` that the dependency set could not honour,
and CI was the only thing testing it. Raising the floor makes the metadata true.
Installing from the lockfile closes the second half of the gap — CI and a developer
machine now install the identical set, so GB-59's clean-clone audit is exercised on every
push rather than being discovered in the report week.

**Consequence.** Python 3.11 is no longer supported; the project requires 3.12+, which
is what the development machine already runs. A dependency change now means regenerating
`requirements.lock`, or CI installs the old set and the failure appears as a confusing
test error rather than a resolution error. The lockfile is frozen on 3.12, so the CI
Python version and the lockfile must be changed together.

## 2026-08-14 — GB-3: the validation harness sits above the live path in the layer contract

**Decision.** The import-linter layers contract, highest first, is: `experiments`,
`backtest`, `dashboard`, `explain`, `engine`, `model`, `features`, `data`, `contracts`,
`config`. A second `forbidden` contract stops `live_loop` and `replay` — top-level
modules the layers contract does not reach — from importing `backtest` or `experiments`.
`smoke_offline` is deliberately exempt: it is the harness's own entry point.

**Reasoning.** Spec §3.1 draws the harness as cross-cutting rather than as a layer, so
it has no natural rung on the ladder. What the spec actually requires is asymmetric: the
harness must be free to drive models, features and data — a walk-forward run does
exactly that — while the live path must never reach into it. Placing the harness at the
top gets both from one contract, because a layers contract already forbids lower layers
from importing higher ones. The alternative, putting it at the bottom, would have
inverted the rule and let the live loop import the backtester.

**Consequence.** A backtest module may import anything below it. Nothing in the live
path can import a backtest or experiments module, and the tests prove it: a deliberate
`live_loop -> backtest.engine` import breaks the forbidden contract, and a deliberate
`data -> features` import breaks the layers contract. `reference/` is outside both
contracts by construction, since `root_package = "glassbox"`.

## 2026-08-14 — Dependencies pinned to lower bounds; `requirements.lock` committed

**Decision.** Every runtime and dev dependency in `pyproject.toml` carries a `>=` lower
bound set to the version resolved in the development environment (pandas 3.0.5,
numpy 2.5.2, torch 2.13.0, and so on). `requirements.lock` — the full 90-package
`pip freeze` of that environment — is committed alongside it. A clean clone that must
reproduce reported results installs the lockfile; `pip install -e ".[dev]"` remains the
day-to-day path.

**Reasoning.** The environment resolved to pandas 3.0.5, a major release with breaking
changes, and to numpy 2.5.2 and torch 2.13.0. Unversioned dependencies make GB-59's
acceptance criterion — a clean clone reproduces the reported results — unachievable,
and the failure would surface in October during the report week rather than now. Lower
bounds document what the code was written against; the lockfile is what actually
reproduces. Both are needed: bounds alone drift, a lock alone hides the intent.

**Consequence.** GB-59 verifies the clean clone against `requirements.lock`, and GB-12's
README must point a newcomer at it. The lockfile is regenerated whenever a dependency is
added or deliberately upgraded, and that regeneration is itself an entry in this file.
`pip freeze --exclude-editable` is used so the lockfile carries no absolute path to this
machine's checkout.

## 2026-08-14 — GB-1: the declared dependency set

**Decision.** `pyproject.toml` declares twelve runtime dependencies — pandas, numpy,
pyyaml, torch, yfinance, alpaca-py, PyWavelets, scipy, streamlit,
pandas-market-calendars, python-dotenv, pyarrow — and five dev extras: pytest,
hypothesis, import-linter, ruff, black. The formatters live in the extra so that
`pip install -e ".[dev]"` is the single command that produces a working local
environment, and CI installs exactly what a developer installs. Versions are unpinned
for now; GB-59 (reproducibility audit) is where a lock is added if a clean clone does
not reproduce.

**Reasoning.** This is the baseline set the spec's architecture already implies — one
library per named responsibility, nothing speculative. Recording it here satisfies the
`CLAUDE.md` §4 rule that a dependency needs a line in this file, so later additions are
visible as additions rather than lost in a diff.

**Consequence.** Anything beyond this list requires a new entry here before it is
installed. `reference/` is excluded from packaging, linting and pytest collection in the
same file, so its dependencies are never ours.

## 2026-08-14 — Sprint-table weekday labels corrected against the 2026 calendar

**Decision.** `SOLO_BUILD_PLAN.md` §7 dated the code freeze "Fri 3 Oct". 3 October 2026
is a **Saturday**; the row now reads "Sat 3 Oct". All 52 dated cells across the four
sprint tables were checked against the real calendar — this was the only error. The
freeze date itself (3 October) is unchanged.

**Reasoning.** The code freeze is the one deadline in the plan that converts unfinished
work into declared future work. A day-name that disagrees with the date invites the
reader to resolve the conflict in whichever direction suits them, which in practice
means Saturday's work quietly leaking past the freeze.

**Consequence.** Sprint 4 day 8 (Sat 3 Oct — GB-49/50/51) and the freeze now agree:
the study runner, COF sweep and significance tests land *on* the freeze day, not after
it. No schedule change; the plan already had it that way.

## 2026-08-14 — `Attribution.per_lag` becomes optional; `Attribution` becomes keyword-only

**Decision.** In spec §4.2, `per_lag: np.ndarray` becomes `per_lag: np.ndarray | None = None`,
documented in the docstring as optional because GB-31 is cut. The dataclass is
additionally declared `kw_only=True`.

**Reasoning.** GB-31 (per-lag heatmap) is cut from scope, but the frozen schema declared
`per_lag` as required — a contract that obliges every implementation to populate a field
nobody consumes. The alternatives were filling it with zeros, which fakes data an
exactness test could later assert against, or deleting the field, which would make
adding the heatmap a contract change. Making it optional keeps the shape of the future
feature at zero present cost. `kw_only=True` is a mechanical consequence: a dataclass
field with a default may not precede fields without one, so in-place optionality
requires either reordering the frozen field order or constructing by keyword. Keyword
construction is the smaller change and the better style for a five-field record.

**Consequence.** Implementations return `per_lag=None`. `Attribution` is always
constructed with named arguments — positional construction now raises `TypeError`.
**Do not "simplify" `kw_only=True` away.** It is load-bearing: without it, a defaulted
`per_lag` sitting before the three fields that have no default is a `TypeError` at
import time. Reordering the fields to avoid that would change a frozen contract for no
benefit, and `forecast_total` cannot take a default because it is the exactness target. The
exactness contract (§4.4, GB-33) is untouched: it tests `per_channel` and
`forecast_total` only. GB-31 can be un-cut later without a contract change.

## 2026-08-14 — `SOLO_BUILD_PLAN.md` governs execution; the Jira 70/30 split is a formal record

**Decision.** One developer writes every line. `SOLO_BUILD_PLAN.md` is the real build
order. The `Own` column in spec §9, the load-balance table, and the two-person split in
`CLAUDE.md` §6 exist only for the formal academic record and are ignored when planning
work. `CLAUDE.md` §6 has been replaced with a single line saying exactly that.

**Reasoning.** Three documents disagreed about who builds what, and `CLAUDE.md` is read
at the start of every session. An agent that believes a task belongs to someone else may
defer, stub, or wait on it — the one failure mode a solo build cannot absorb.

**Consequence.** Task ownership carries no scheduling meaning. Frozen contracts (§4)
remain in force, now justified by the cost of changing an interface mid-build rather
than by parallel work. `glassbox_jira_tasks.csv` and the submitted documents keep the
70/30 split unchanged.

## 2026-08-12 — FITS adopted as the spectral core; DLinear retained as baseline

**Decision.** The model layer holds three forecasters: `Persistence` (reference),
`DLinear` (established baseline, already understood), and `FITS` (new spectral core).
Wavelet channels remain, repositioned from "the core contribution" to
"the explicit arm of the comparative study".

**Reasoning.** FITS and wavelets are not competitors — they sit in different layers.
FITS is a model; wavelets are features. Keeping DLinear is what makes FITS measurable;
without a baseline there is no claim to make. This framing turns an assumption
("wavelets help") into a measurable question ("explicit or implicit frequency
decomposition — which helps more, if either?").

**Consequence.** The study grid becomes 3 models x 2 feature configs, with the
`FITS x C2_hybrid` cell deliberately empty (see spec §6.4).

---

## 2026-08-12 — Execution window compressed from 14 weeks to 8

**Decision.** The plan is rebuilt around 15 Aug – 10 Oct 2026: four two-week sprints,
three hard gates.

**Reasoning.** The original 14-week plan is not executable in 8 weeks.

**Consequence.** The ablation grid shrinks; `NLinear` becomes optional; the
Regime Guard moves to declared future work; Sprint 4 carries the entire report
and nothing technical may spill into it.
